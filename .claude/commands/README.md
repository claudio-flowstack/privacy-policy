# Claude Code Slash Commands

**Explicit orchestration layer for composable workflows.**

Slash commands provide direct user control over Claude's behavior by composing skills, other commands, and scripts into powerful multi-stage pipelines.

---

## Commands vs Skills

| Feature | Commands | Skills |
|---------|----------|--------|
| **Invocation** | Explicit (`/command-name`) | Auto-discovered by Claude |
| **Purpose** | Orchestration & workflow composition | Domain expertise |
| **User Control** | High - you decide when to use | Low - Claude decides |
| **Composition** | Can chain skills, commands, scripts | Cannot compose (referenced by commands) |
| **Arguments** | Accepts structured arguments | Uses conversation context |

**Think of it this way:**
- **Skills** = Tools in Claude's toolbox (auto-selected when relevant)
- **Commands** = Recipes that combine multiple tools in sequence

---

## Available Commands

### `/journal` - Log Decisions with Smart Categorization
**Purpose**: Capture architectural decisions, bug solutions, patterns, and process improvements with automatic category detection from title/content keywords

**Usage**:
```bash
# Smart detection (recommended) - category auto-detected from keywords
/journal "Aurora vs DynamoDB for caching"              # → architecture
/journal "Lambda timeout in production"                # → error
/journal "Validation gates before workflow nodes"      # → pattern
/journal "Research-before-iteration saves deploy cycles"  # → meta

# Explicit category (backward compatible) - override auto-detection
/journal architecture "Aurora vs DynamoDB for caching"
/journal error "Lambda timeout in production"
/journal pattern "Validation gates before workflow nodes"
/journal meta "Research-before-iteration saves deploy cycles"
```

**Categories**:
- `architecture` - Pre-ADR exploration, design decisions
- `error` - Bug investigations and solutions
- `pattern` - Reusable code or workflow patterns
- `meta` - Process improvements, tooling enhancements

---

### `/validate` - Validate Claims with Evidence
**Purpose**: Validate claims and assumptions with evidence before implementing features or making decisions

**Usage**:
```bash
/validate "All Lambda functions have < 5s timeout"
/validate "Users rarely use the export feature" behavior
/validate "Performance regression caused by new database query" hypothesis
```

**Validation types** (auto-detected):
- `code` - Code structure validation (functions, imports, patterns)
- `performance` - Latency thresholds, resource usage
- `config` - Environment variables, infrastructure state
- `behavior` - User preferences, system patterns
- `hypothesis` - Root cause hypotheses, causal relationships

**Output**:
- Status: ✅ TRUE | ❌ FALSE | ⚠️ PARTIALLY TRUE | 🤔 INCONCLUSIVE
- Evidence summary (supporting, contradicting, missing)
- Analysis with confidence level
- Recommendations based on validation result

**Core Principle**: "Validate assumptions before implementing" - evidence-based decision making prevents wasted effort

---

### `/proof` - Formal Deductive Proofs
**Purpose**: Construct formal proofs about system properties from constraints and axioms

**Usage**:
```bash
# Capacity planning
/proof "Lambda with 512MB can process 100MB images"

# Type safety
/proof "All API endpoints return JSON-serializable data"

# Resource management
/proof "All database connections are properly closed"

# Save proof document
/proof "System can handle 1000 req/s" save
```

**Proof types** (auto-detected):
- `direct` - Given axioms → derive conclusion
- `contradiction` - Assume opposite → find contradiction
- `counterexample` - Find case that violates property
- `construction` - Build explicit example
- `induction` - Base case + inductive step

**Output**: Formal proof structure with axioms, derivation steps, conclusion, and QED

**Core Principle**: "What MUST be true given constraints?" - deductive reasoning complements empirical validation

---

## Exploration Commands

### `/explore` - Divergent Solution Exploration
**Purpose**: Systematically explore ALL potential solutions before committing to an approach. Prevents anchoring bias by generating, evaluating, and ranking alternatives with objective criteria.

**Usage**:
```bash
# Comprehensive exploration
/explore "How to expose backtester functionality to users"

# Focused exploration (weighted criterion)
/explore "Which chart library for Telegram Mini App" --focus=performance
/explore "Where to store historical price data" --focus=cost
/explore "How to manage global state in React" --focus=simplicity
```

**When to use**:
- Multiple valid approaches exist (architecture, library choice, API design)
- Decision has significant impact (cost, performance, maintainability)
- Novel problem domain (no obvious best practice)
- Exploring trade-offs between competing priorities

**When to skip**:
- Only one viable approach exists
- Best practice is well-established
- Decision is easily reversible
- Time-sensitive tactical fix

**Output**: Exploration document at `.claude/explorations/{date}-{slug}.md` including:
- Problem decomposition (requirements, constraints, stakeholders)
- Solution space (3-5 alternatives with pros/cons)
- Evaluation matrix (scored by performance, cost, complexity, maintainability)
- Ranked recommendations (top choice with clear rationale)
- Resources gathered (docs, examples, case studies)
- Next steps (`/specify` top choice or `/what-if` to compare)

**Workflow**: Diverge → Converge
```bash
# Step 1: Diverge (explore all options)
/explore "How to implement real-time price updates"
# → Output: explorations/2025-12-25-realtime-prices.md
# → Top choice: Server-Sent Events (SSE)

# Step 2: Converge (specify chosen approach)
/specify "Server-Sent Events (SSE) for real-time price updates"
# → Output: specifications/2025-12-25-sse-price-updates.md

# Step 3: Plan and implement
EnterPlanMode
```

**Core Principle**: "Explore before committing" - systematic exploration prevents anchoring on first idea and reveals better alternatives

---

### `/what-if` - Comprehensive Comparison Command
**Purpose**: Compare alternatives, explore scenarios, and analyze relationships between concepts

**Three Modes**:
1. **Binary comparison** (scenario analysis) - "What if X instead of Y?"
2. **Multi-way comparison** - "Compare X vs Y vs Z"
3. **Relationship analysis** - "How do X and Y relate?"

**Usage**:
```bash
# Pattern 1: Binary comparison (scenario analysis)
/what-if "We used PostgreSQL instead of Aurora"
/what-if "Lambda timeout was 15s instead of 30s"

# Pattern 2: Multi-way comparison (NEW)
/what-if "compare Redis vs DynamoDB vs ElastiCache for caching"
/what-if "compare Lambda vs ECS vs EKS for compute"

# Pattern 3: Relationship analysis (NEW)
/what-if "analyze relationship between caching and CDN"
/what-if "how do microservices and serverless relate"

# Save analysis
/what-if "compare PostgreSQL vs MySQL vs Aurora" save
```

**Binary comparison structure** (existing):
- Current reality → Under new assumption → What breaks → What improves → Insights → Recommendation

**Multi-way comparison structure** (NEW):
- Comparison context → Options analysis → Comparison matrix → Similarities/Differences → Relationships → Recommendation

**Relationship analysis structure** (NEW):
- Concepts definition → Similarity/Difference analysis → Relationship types (part-whole, complement, substitution, composition) → Interaction patterns → Recommendation

**Core Principle**: "Explore before committing" - systematic comparison prevents anchoring on first idea and reveals better alternatives

---

### `/specify` - Lightweight Design Sketches
**Purpose**: Create design specifications without full plan mode ceremony

**Usage**:
```bash
# API design
/specify "REST API for portfolio backtester"

# Schema design
/specify "DynamoDB schema for user preferences" schema

# Alternative exploration
/specify "SQS-based async processing" alternative

# Spike planning
/specify "Proof-of-concept: WebSocket updates" spike
```

**Focus types** (auto-detected):
- `api` - API endpoint design
- `schema` - Database/data structure design
- `workflow` - Process/workflow design
- `alternative` - Alternative approaches
- `spike` - Proof-of-concept experiments

**vs Plan Mode**: Specify = exploratory sketch, Plan Mode = implementation-ready plan

**Core Principle**: "Sometimes you just need to think out loud" - quick designs for exploration

---

## Meta-Operations (Observational Learning Loop)

The following commands form a **meta-cognitive learning loop** that captures experience, analyzes patterns, and evolves principles:

```
/observe → /decompose → /abstract → /journal → /evolve
(capture)  (analyze)   (generalize) (interpret) (meta-learn)
```

### `/observe` - Capture Execution Traces
**Purpose**: Capture **what happened** without interpretation, enabling future analysis

**Smart Syntax** (auto-detects mode):
```bash
/observe "Deployed Lambda with new config"          # Detects: execution
/observe "Lambda timeout after 30 seconds"          # Detects: failure
/observe "Chose iterative approach over research"   # Detects: behavior
```

**Explicit mode** (optional):
```bash
/observe execution "Deployed Lambda with new config"
/observe failure "API timeout during peak traffic"
/observe behavior "Chose iterative approach over research"
```

**Detection**: Analyzes keywords (deployed/timeout/chose) to determine mode automatically

**Core Principle**: "Observations are immutable facts that can be re-analyzed when interpretations prove wrong"

---

### `/decompose` - Break Down Goals or Failures
**Purpose**: Decompose complex entities into components, dependencies, and preconditions

**Smart Syntax** (auto-detects mode):
```bash
/decompose "Implement zero-downtime deployment"     # Detects: goal (action verb)
/decompose "Lambda timeout in production"           # Detects: failure (error keyword)
/decompose ".claude/observations/.../failure-*.md"  # Detects: failure (file path)
```

**Explicit mode** (optional):
```bash
/decompose goal "Implement zero-downtime deployment"
/decompose failure .claude/observations/2025-12-23/failure-143205-lambda-timeout.md
```

**Detection**: File paths → failure, action verbs (Add/Implement) → goal, error keywords → failure

**Core Principle**: "Everything has parts" - understanding part-whole relationships reveals hidden complexity

---

### `/abstract` - Extract Patterns from Experience
**Purpose**: Generalize patterns from multiple concrete instances

**Smart Syntax** (auto-detects pattern type):
```bash
/abstract ".claude/observations/*/failure-*.md"     # Detects: failure_mode
/abstract ".claude/observations/*/execution-*.md"   # Detects: workflow
/abstract ".claude/journals/architecture/*.md"      # Detects: architecture
```

**Explicit type** (optional):
```bash
/abstract ".claude/journals/error/*.md" failure_mode  # Force failure_mode
/abstract ".claude/decompositions/goal-*.md" workflow # Force workflow
```

**Detection**: Analyzes file paths (/failure-/ → failure_mode, /execution-/ → workflow)

**Core Principle**: "Intelligence generalizes" - patterns extracted from specific instances enable reuse

---

### `/journal` - Document Interpreted Knowledge
**Purpose**: Capture interpreted solutions, decisions, and patterns

**Usage**:
```bash
/journal architecture "Aurora vs DynamoDB for caching"
/journal error "Lambda timeout in production"
/journal pattern "Validation gates before workflow nodes"
/journal meta "Research-before-iteration saves deploy cycles"
```

**Categories**:
- `architecture` - Pre-ADR exploration, design decisions
- `error` - Bug investigations and solutions
- `pattern` - Reusable code or workflow patterns
- `meta` - Process improvements, tooling enhancements

**Workflow**: Observations (facts) → Journals (interpretation) → ADRs (formal decisions)

---

### `/report` - Summarize Work Session
**Purpose**: Generate markdown summary of recent work, decisions, and next steps

**Usage**:
```bash
/report                    # Current session
/report 1h                 # Last hour
/report today              # Today's work
/report session output.md  # Save to file
```

**Output includes**:
- Summary of work accomplished
- Topics covered with outcomes
- Decisions made
- Problems solved
- Next steps / action items
- Links to journal entries and observations created

---

### `/evolve` - Reflect & Evolve Knowledge
**Purpose**: Meta-operation to detect drift between documented principles and actual practices

**Usage**:
```bash
/evolve              # Review all areas
/evolve testing      # Focus on testing patterns
/evolve deployment   # Focus on deployment
```

**What it does**:
1. Reviews recent commits and journal entries
2. Compares CLAUDE.md principles vs actual code
3. Identifies undocumented patterns
4. Proposes updates to CLAUDE.md and skills
5. Generates report with priorities

---

## Debugging

### `/bug-hunt` - Systematic Bug Investigation
**Purpose**: Type-specific bug investigation workflows for production errors, performance issues, race conditions, and data corruption

**Usage**:
```bash
# Auto-detect bug type from symptom
/bug-hunt "Lambda timeout after 30 seconds"
/bug-hunt "API latency increased from 200ms to 2s"
/bug-hunt "Intermittent 500 errors on /api/backtest"
/bug-hunt "Memory usage growing over time"

# Explicit bug type (override auto-detection)
/bug-hunt "slow query" performance
/bug-hunt "sometimes fails" race-condition
```

**Bug types** (auto-detected):
- `production-error` - Errors, exceptions, crashes, timeouts
- `performance` - Slowness, latency spikes, bottlenecks
- `data-corruption` - Incorrect data, missing fields
- `race-condition` - Intermittent, flaky, non-deterministic
- `memory-leak` - Memory growth, OOM errors
- `integration-failure` - External API/service issues

**Investigation workflow**:
```
Symptom → Classify Type → Gather Evidence → Form Hypotheses
                                                    ↓
          Test Systematically → Root Cause → Reproduction + Fixes
```

**Output**: Investigation report at `.claude/bug-hunts/{date}-{slug}.md` including:
- Evidence gathered (logs, metrics, code, git changes)
- Hypotheses tested (eliminated/confirmed/uncertain)
- Root cause + confidence level (High/Medium/Low)
- Reproduction steps
- Fix candidates with pros/cons/effort
- Recommended fix + rationale

**Core Principle**: "Systematic investigation beats random debugging" - structure prevents thrashing

**vs Other Debugging Tools**:
- `/observe failure` - Captures what happened (immutable record)
- `/decompose failure` - Breaks down failure structure
- `error-investigation` skill - AWS/Lambda patterns (auto-applied)
- **`/bug-hunt`** - **Active investigation with type-specific workflows**

---

## Worktree Management

Manage parallel git worktrees for concurrent agent execution. Enables multiple agents to work on different tasks simultaneously without file conflicts.

### `/wt-spin-off` - Create Branch and Worktree
**Purpose**: Create new branch and git worktree for parallel agent execution

**Usage**:
```bash
/wt-spin-off "task description"
```

**Examples**:
```bash
/wt-spin-off "fix timeout bug"
/wt-spin-off "add backtester API"
/wt-spin-off "refactor workflow layer"
/wt-spin-off "investigate memory leak"
```

**What it creates**:
- Branch: `wt-{date}-{time}-{slug}-{random}` (e.g., `wt-2025-12-24-143052-fix-timeout-bug-a3f2`)
- Directory: `{parent}/{repo}-wt-{slug}` (e.g., `../[PROJECT_NAME]_telegram-wt-fix-timeout-bug`)

**Features**:
- Deterministic naming with collision prevention
- Disk space check (warns if < 1GB)
- Independent `.claude/` state per worktree
- Creates from current HEAD (works from any branch)

**Use Case**: Run multiple agents in parallel without conflicts. Each agent gets isolated workspace.

---

### `/wt-list` - List Active Worktrees
**Purpose**: List all active git worktrees with activity status and cleanup suggestions

**Usage**:
```bash
/wt-list
```

**What it shows**:
- All worktrees (main + additional)
- Last modified time and relative age
- Activity status (🟢 Active, 🟡 Idle, 🔴 Stale)
- Branch names and commit messages
- Cleanup suggestions for stale worktrees (> 12 hours)

**Activity Thresholds**:
- 🟢 **Active**: < 30 minutes (currently being worked on)
- 🟡 **Idle**: 30 min - 12 hours (work paused)
- 🔴 **Stale**: > 12 hours (likely abandoned, should review)

**Use Case**: Track parallel agent workflows and identify abandoned worktrees.

---

### `/wt-merge` - Merge Worktree Branch to Dev
**Purpose**: Merge worktree branch back to dev with safety validation

**Usage**:
```bash
/wt-merge "slug"
```

**Examples**:
```bash
/wt-merge "investigate-lambda-timeout"
/wt-merge "rest-api-for-backtester"
```

**Safety Checks**:
- ✅ Must be on dev branch
- ✅ Dev must be clean (no uncommitted changes)
- ✅ Dev should be up-to-date with remote
- ✅ Worktree branch must exist
- ✅ Detects if already merged

**Merge Strategy**: Fast-forward only (linear history)
- If fast-forward fails, suggests rebase
- Preserves clean git history (no merge commits)
- Enforces best practice (rebase before merge)

**Post-Merge**: Worktree still exists (user decides when to remove separately)

**Use Case**: Integrate parallel work back to dev safely.

---

### `/wt-remove` - Remove Worktree Directory
**Purpose**: Remove worktree directory with safety validation and optional branch deletion

**Usage**:
```bash
/wt-remove "slug"
```

**Examples**:
```bash
/wt-remove "investigate-lambda-timeout"
/wt-remove "failed-experiment"
```

**Safety Checks**:
- ✅ Checks if branch is merged to dev
- ✅ Warns about uncommitted changes
- ✅ Prevents removal of main worktree
- ✅ Prevents removal if inside worktree
- ✅ Handles broken references (directory already deleted)

**Branch Deletion**:
- If merged: Prompts to delete branch (safe)
- If not merged: Keeps branch, requires manual force delete

**Use Case**: Clean up worktrees after work complete or discard failed experiments.

---

## Worktree Workflow Example

**Parallel Agent Execution**:
```bash
# Terminal 1: Agent investigating bug
/wt-spin-off "investigate lambda timeout"
cd ../[PROJECT_NAME]_telegram-wt-investigate-lambda-timeout
/bug-hunt "Lambda timeout after 30 seconds"
# ... work complete ...
/wt-merge "investigate-lambda-timeout"
/wt-remove "investigate-lambda-timeout"

# Terminal 2: Agent designing API (parallel!)
/wt-spin-off "REST API for backtester"
cd ../[PROJECT_NAME]_telegram-wt-rest-api-for-backtester
/specify api "Backtester REST API"
# ... still working ...

# Terminal 3: Check all worktrees
/wt-list
# Shows both worktrees with activity status
```

**Benefits**:
- ✅ No file conflicts between agents
- ✅ Independent `.claude/` state per worktree
- ✅ Each agent works at own pace
- ✅ Merge when ready (no coordination needed)

---

## Code Quality

### `/refactor` - Analyze Complexity & Hotspots
**Purpose**: Identify high-priority refactoring opportunities using complexity analysis and git churn

**Usage**:
```bash
# Analyze single file (complexity mode)
/refactor src/workflow/workflow_nodes.py

# Analyze directory (all mode: complexity + hotspots)
/refactor src/workflow/

# Explicit hotspots analysis
/refactor src/ hotspots

# Save report to file
/refactor src/workflow/ report.md
```

**Analysis modes** (auto-detected):
- `complexity` - Cyclomatic/cognitive complexity, LOC, parameters
- `hotspots` - High churn (git commits) + high complexity
- `all` - Both complexity and hotspots (default for directories)

**Priority Matrix**:
| Churn | Complexity | Priority | Action |
|-------|-----------|----------|--------|
| High (> 15) | High (> 10 CC) | **P0** 🔥 | Refactor immediately |
| High | Low | P1 ⚠️ | Monitor |
| Low | High | P2 📝 | Schedule in sprint |
| Low | Low | P3 ✅ | Maintain quality |

**Output**: Verbose P0/P1/P2/P3 breakdown with pattern recommendations AND example refactoring for top P0 function

**Core Principle**: "Measure first, refactor second" - use data to prioritize where refactoring has maximum impact

---

### `/explain` - Multi-Stage Concept Explanation
**Purpose**: Demonstrate command composition via clarify → search → synthesize pipeline

**Usage**:
```bash
/explain "Lambda cold start optimization"
/explain "Aurora-First Data Architecture"
/explain "Validation gates before workflow nodes"
```

**Pipeline stages**:
1. **Clarify**: Determine audience level, context, depth needed
2. **Search**: Find info in CLAUDE.md, skills, docs, codebase
3. **Synthesize**: Generate structured explanation with examples

---

## Command Composition Patterns

Commands can orchestrate multiple capabilities in sequence:

### 1. Command Invokes Skill

**Pattern**: Reference skill in `composition` frontmatter

```markdown
---
composition:
  - skill: research
  - skill: code-review
---

# In prompt template:
Invoke the `research` skill to investigate root cause:
[Include research skill's investigation methodology]

Then invoke the `code-review` skill to validate the fix:
[Include code-review security and performance patterns]
```

**Example**: `/update-capability` uses the `research` skill for systematic investigation

---

### 2. Command Chains Command

**Pattern**: Sequential execution via `composition`

```markdown
---
composition:
  - command: report
  - command: journal
---

# In prompt template:
First, generate work session report:
Execute /report session

Then, prompt user to journal key decisions:
Execute /journal [category inferred from report]
```

**Example**: End-of-day workflow could chain `/report` → `/journal` → commit

---

### 3. Command Runs Script

**Pattern**: Reference script in `composition`

```markdown
---
composition:
  - script: .claude/skills/refacter/scripts/analyze_complexity.py
  - skill: refacter
---

# In prompt template:
Run complexity analysis:
```bash
python .claude/skills/refacter/scripts/analyze_complexity.py src/
```

Then use refacter skill to interpret results and suggest improvements.
```

**Example**: Complexity review could run analysis script, then invoke refactor skill

---

## Argument Handling

Commands accept arguments via structured schema:

### Defining Arguments

```markdown
---
arg_schema:
  - name: category
    required: true
    description: One of architecture, error, pattern, meta
  - name: title
    required: true
    description: Title of entry (quoted if spaces)
  - name: details
    required: false
    description: Optional additional details
---
```

### Using Arguments in Prompts

```markdown
## Prompt Template

Category: $1
Title: $2
Optional details: ${3:-Not provided}

All arguments as single string: $ARGUMENTS
```

**Placeholder syntax**:
- `$1`, `$2`, `$3` - Individual positional arguments
- `$ARGUMENTS` - All arguments as space-separated string
- `${n:-default}` - Argument with default value if not provided

### Argument Examples

```bash
# Required arguments only
/journal architecture "Aurora caching decision"

# With optional argument
/journal error "Lambda timeout" "Occurred during peak traffic"

# Arguments with spaces (use quotes)
/journal pattern "Validation gates before workflow execution"

# Multiple arguments
/report session "output-$(date +%Y%m%d).md"
```

---

## Creating New Commands

### File Structure

Commands live in `.claude/commands/{command-name}.md`:

```markdown
---
name: command-name
description: Brief description (1-2 sentences)
accepts_args: true | false
arg_schema:
  - name: arg1
    required: true | false
    description: What this argument is for
composition:
  - skill: skill-name        # Can invoke skills
  - command: other-command   # Can chain commands
  - script: path/to/script   # Can run scripts
---

# Command Name

**Purpose**: What this command accomplishes

**When to use**: Scenarios where this command is appropriate

---

## Execution Flow

1. Step 1: Description of what happens
2. Step 2: Next action
3. Step 3: Final step

---

## Prompt Template

You are executing the `/{name}` command with arguments: $ARGUMENTS

[Command-specific instructions that Claude will follow...]

Step 1: [First action]
Step 2: [Second action]
Step 3: [Final action]

---

## Examples

### Example 1: Basic usage
```bash
/command-name arg1
```

### Example 2: With multiple arguments
```bash
/command-name arg1 arg2 "arg with spaces"
```

### Example 3: Optional arguments
```bash
/command-name required-arg optional-arg
```
```

---

## Command Design Guidelines

### When to Create a Command

Create a command when you need:
- **Explicit control** over when workflow runs (vs auto-discovery)
- **Composition** of multiple skills/commands/scripts
- **Structured arguments** with validation
- **Repeatable workflow** with consistent steps

**Don't create a command for**:
- Domain expertise (create a skill instead)
- One-time operations (just ask Claude)
- Simple shortcuts (not worth the overhead)

### Command Naming

- Use verb-noun format: `/journal`, `/report`, `/evolve`
- Be concise but descriptive
- Avoid abbreviations unless universally understood
- Match user's mental model of the action
- Meta-operations use single verbs: `/observe`, `/decompose`, `/abstract`

### Prompt Template Tips

- Be explicit about what Claude should do
- Use numbered steps for clarity
- Include examples in the prompt
- Reference skills by name when invoking them
- Provide fallback behavior for optional arguments

---

## Integration with Existing Skills

Commands complement the 9 existing auto-discovered skills:

| Skill | What It Provides | How Commands Use It |
|-------|------------------|---------------------|
| **research** | Investigation methodology | `/decompose` and `/abstract` invoke for systematic analysis |
| **code-review** | Security, performance checks | Commands can invoke for validation |
| **testing-workflow** | Test patterns | `/abstract` can extract test patterns |
| **refactor** | Complexity analysis | Commands can run scripts, apply patterns |
| **deployment** | Zero-downtime strategies | `/observe execution` captures deployment workflows |
| **error-investigation** | Multi-layer debugging | `/observe failure` → `/decompose failure` → skill update |
| **database-migration** | Migration patterns | Commands can validate migrations |
| **telegram-uiux** | UI patterns | `/abstract` can extract UI workflow patterns |
| **line-uiux** | Legacy patterns | Commands avoid (maintenance mode) |

**Key principle**: Skills provide expertise, commands orchestrate workflows

**Meta-operations learning loop**:
```
Concrete experience → /observe (capture facts)
     ↓
Analysis → /decompose (break down into parts)
     ↓
Generalization → /abstract (extract patterns)
     ↓
Documentation → /journal (interpret and document)
     ↓
Skill graduation → Pattern moves into skill docs
     ↓
Principle evolution → /evolve detects drift, updates CLAUDE.md
```

## FAQ

### When should I use a command vs just asking Claude?

**Use a command when**:
- You need consistent, repeatable workflow
- Multiple steps need to happen in specific order
- You want explicit control over invocation timing
- Arguments need validation

**Just ask Claude when**:
- It's a one-time request
- Context is sufficient without structure
- Flexibility is more important than consistency

### Can commands call other commands?

Yes! Commands can chain other commands via the `composition` field. The chained command executes in sequence.

Example: `/end-of-day` could chain `/report` → `/journal` → commit message generation

### What's the difference between commands and skills?

**Commands** = Explicit workflows you invoke (`/command`)
**Skills** = Expertise Claude auto-applies when relevant

Think: Commands are recipes, skills are ingredients.

### How do I pass arguments with spaces?

Use quotes:
```bash
/journal architecture "This is a single argument with spaces"
```

### Can commands invoke skills that are auto-discovered?

Yes! Commands can reference skills in their prompts. The skill's patterns and methodology are available to the command.

### What if I have a typo in a command name?

Claude Code will show available commands. Check `.claude/commands/` directory for exact names.

## Next Steps

### Getting Started

1. **Start with `/observe`**: Capture execution traces and failures as you work
   - After deployments: `/observe execution "Deployed X to Y"`
   - When errors occur: `/observe failure "Error description"`

2. **Use `/journal`**: Document solutions and decisions
   - After solving bugs: `/journal error "Bug title"`
   - When making choices: `/journal architecture "Decision title"`

3. **Try `/decompose`**: Break down complex goals before implementing
   - Before starting: `/decompose goal "Feature description"`
   - When debugging: `/decompose failure .claude/observations/{file}.md`

### Building the Learning Loop

4. **Extract patterns with `/abstract`**: After 3+ similar cases
   - Recurring failures: `/abstract ".claude/observations/*/failure-*.md" failure_mode`
   - Common workflows: `/abstract ".claude/observations/*/execution-*.md" workflow`

5. **Evolve principles with `/evolve`**: Monthly review
   - Detect drift: `/evolve`
   - Focus areas: `/evolve testing` or `/evolve deployment`

6. **Summarize sessions with `/report`**: End of day/week
   - Session summary: `/report`
   - Save to file: `/report session output.md`

### Advanced

7. **Try `/explain`**: See command composition in action
   - Multi-stage pipeline demo
   - Learn how commands can chain together

For detailed command documentation, see individual command files in `.claude/commands/`.
