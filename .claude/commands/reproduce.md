# Reproduce Command

**Purpose**: Convert observation files into actionable reproduction guides for debugging, onboarding, and documentation

**Core Principle**: "Reproduction enables fixing" - if you can't reproduce it, you can't fix it. Observations capture what happened; reproduction guides show how to trigger it again.

**When to use**:
- After capturing failure observation → create repro steps for issue report
- After complex deployment → create runbook from execution trace
- After behavioral pattern → create example workflow
- For onboarding → show how specific tasks are done
- Before fixing → verify you can reproduce the issue

---

## Quick Reference

```bash
# From failure observation
/reproduce ".claude/observations/2025-12-23/failure-143205-lambda-timeout.md"

# From execution trace
/reproduce ".claude/observations/2025-12-23/execution-143052-deployed-lambda.md"

# From behavior pattern
/reproduce ".claude/observations/2025-12-23/behavior-143420-iteration-over-research.md"
```

---

## Observation Modes

### `execution` - Execution Trace → Deployment Runbook

**Input**: Observation capturing successful execution (deployment, migration, complex task)

**Output**: Step-by-step runbook with:
- Prerequisites (environment, tools, permissions)
- Exact commands to execute (from observation)
- Verification steps
- Expected timing
- Rollback procedure

**Use case**: "How do I deploy this?" or "How was this task done?"

---

### `failure` - Failure Surface → Bug Reproduction

**Input**: Observation capturing failure (error, timeout, crash)

**Output**: Bug reproduction guide with:
- Prerequisites (input data, environment state)
- Steps to trigger failure
- Expected error message
- Debugging commands
- Verification that fix resolves issue

**Use case**: "How do I reproduce this bug?" or "How do I test my fix?"

---

### `behavior` - Behavioral Pattern → Workflow Example

**Input**: Observation capturing decision-making behavior (tool usage, approach choice)

**Output**: Workflow example with:
- When to use this approach
- Step-by-step decision process
- Commands executed in sequence
- Principle adherence notes
- Outcome comparison vs alternatives

**Use case**: "When should I use this pattern?" or "How was this decision made?"

---

## Execution Flow

### Step 1: Validate Input

```bash
OBSERVATION_FILE="$1"

# Check file exists
if [[ ! -f "$OBSERVATION_FILE" ]]; then
  echo "❌ Observation file not found: $OBSERVATION_FILE"
  echo ""
  echo "Expected format: .claude/observations/{date}/{mode}-{time}-{slug}.md"
  echo ""
  echo "List recent observations:"
  echo "  find .claude/observations/ -name '*.md' -mtime -7"
  exit 1
fi

# Check file is in observations directory
if [[ ! "$OBSERVATION_FILE" =~ \.claude/observations/ ]]; then
  echo "⚠️  Warning: File is not in .claude/observations/ directory"
  echo "Are you sure this is an observation file?"
fi
```

**Validation checks**:
- File exists
- File is in `.claude/observations/` directory
- File has observation frontmatter

---

### Step 2: Parse Observation File

```bash
# Extract frontmatter
MODE=$(awk '/^mode:/ {print $2; exit}' "$OBSERVATION_FILE")
CONTEXT=$(awk '/^context:/ {$1=""; print substr($0,2); exit}' "$OBSERVATION_FILE")
DATE=$(awk '/^date:/ {print $2; exit}' "$OBSERVATION_FILE")
ENVIRONMENT=$(awk '/^environment:/ {print $2; exit}' "$OBSERVATION_FILE")
TAGS=$(awk '/^tags:/ {$1=""; print substr($0,2); exit}' "$OBSERVATION_FILE")

# Validate mode
if [[ ! "$MODE" =~ ^(execution|failure|behavior)$ ]]; then
  echo "❌ Invalid observation mode: $MODE"
  echo "Expected: execution, failure, or behavior"
  exit 1
fi
```

**Extracted information**:
- Mode (execution/failure/behavior)
- Context (what was happening)
- Date/time observed
- Environment (dev/staging/prod)
- Tags

---

### Step 3: Extract Content Sections (Mode-Specific)

**For execution mode**:
```bash
# Extract: Actions Taken, Commands Executed, Resources, Timing
ACTIONS=$(sed -n '/## Actions Taken/,/^##/p' "$OBSERVATION_FILE")
COMMANDS=$(sed -n '/## Commands Executed/,/^##/p' "$OBSERVATION_FILE")
RESOURCES=$(sed -n '/## Resources Accessed/,/^##/p' "$OBSERVATION_FILE")
TIMING=$(sed -n '/## Timing/,/^##/p' "$OBSERVATION_FILE")
SIDE_EFFECTS=$(sed -n '/## Side Effects/,/^##/p' "$OBSERVATION_FILE")
```

**For failure mode**:
```bash
# Extract: Error Messages, Input State, Environment, Stack Traces
ERROR_MSG=$(sed -n '/## Error Messages/,/^##/p' "$OBSERVATION_FILE")
INPUT_STATE=$(sed -n '/## Input State/,/^##/p' "$OBSERVATION_FILE")
ENV_CONTEXT=$(sed -n '/## Environment Context/,/^##/p' "$OBSERVATION_FILE")
STACK_TRACE=$(sed -n '/## Stack Traces/,/^##/p' "$OBSERVATION_FILE")
SYMPTOMS=$(sed -n '/## Symptoms Observed/,/^##/p' "$OBSERVATION_FILE")
```

**For behavior mode**:
```bash
# Extract: Decision Points, Tool Usage, Principles
DECISIONS=$(sed -n '/## Decision Points/,/^##/p' "$OBSERVATION_FILE")
TOOL_USAGE=$(sed -n '/## Tool Usage Patterns/,/^##/p' "$OBSERVATION_FILE")
PRINCIPLES=$(sed -n '/## Principle Adherence/,/^##/p' "$OBSERVATION_FILE")
BASELINE=$(sed -n '/## Comparison to Baseline/,/^##/p' "$OBSERVATION_FILE")
```

---

### Step 4: Use Research Skill

Invoke research skill to:
- Systematically analyze observation content
- Extract commands and sequences
- Identify prerequisites and dependencies
- Structure reproduction steps logically
- Avoid missing critical context

---

### Step 5: Generate Reproduction Guide (Mode-Specific Template)

Choose template based on observation mode:

**execution mode** → Generate deployment runbook
**failure mode** → Generate bug reproduction guide
**behavior mode** → Generate workflow example

---

### Step 6: Create Reproduction Directory

```bash
# Create reproductions directory if not exists
mkdir -p .claude/reproductions

# Generate filename
DATE=$(date +%Y-%m-%d)
SLUG=$(basename "$OBSERVATION_FILE" | sed 's/^[a-z]*-[0-9]*-//' | sed 's/.md$//')
REPRO_FILE=".claude/reproductions/${DATE}-${SLUG}.md"

# Write reproduction guide
cat > "$REPRO_FILE" <<'EOF'
{generated content}
EOF
```

---

### Step 7: Output Reproduction Document

Display summary:
```
✅ Reproduction guide created

Source: {observation_file}
Mode: {execution|failure|behavior}
Output: {reproduction_file}

Next steps:
  - Review reproduction guide
  - Test reproduction steps
  - Update if steps incomplete
  - Share with team if needed
```

---

## Error Handling

### File Not Found

```bash
/reproduce ".claude/observations/2025-12-23/nonexistent.md"
```

**Response**:
```
❌ Observation file not found: .claude/observations/2025-12-23/nonexistent.md

Expected format: .claude/observations/{date}/{mode}-{time}-{slug}.md

List recent observations:
  find .claude/observations/ -name '*.md' -mtime -7

Recent observations:
  .claude/observations/2025-12-23/failure-143205-lambda-timeout.md
  .claude/observations/2025-12-23/execution-143052-deployed-lambda.md
```

---

### Invalid Mode

**If observation has invalid mode**:
```
❌ Invalid observation mode: unknown

Expected: execution, failure, or behavior

Please check observation frontmatter:
  head -20 {observation_file}
```

---

### Missing Required Sections

**If observation is incomplete**:
```
⚠️  Warning: Observation missing some sections

Missing sections:
  - Commands Executed
  - Error Messages

Reproduction guide will be partial. Consider:
  - Re-observing with complete data
  - Manually filling in missing information
```

**Continues with partial reproduction guide**

**Workflow**:
1. **Capture**: `/observe` → `.claude/observations/`
2. **Reproduce**: `/reproduce` → `.claude/reproductions/`
3. **Fix**: Apply solution
4. **Document**: `/journal error` → `.claude/journals/error/`

## Integration with Other Commands

### Observe → Reproduce → Fix → Journal

```
/observe failure "Lambda timeout"
    ↓ (captures what happened)
/reproduce .claude/observations/2025-12-23/failure-*.md
    ↓ (creates reproduction guide)
{Fix the bug using reproduction guide}
    ↓
/journal error "Lambda timeout solution"
    ↓ (documents how it was fixed)
```

### Reproduce → Validate → Evolve

```
/reproduce .claude/observations/2025-12-23/execution-*.md
    ↓ (creates runbook)
/validate "Runbook steps work correctly"
    ↓ (tests reproduction guide)
/evolve docs
    ↓ (checks if runbook should become official docs)
```

---

## Principles

### 1. Reproduction Before Fix

Can't fix what you can't reproduce. Always create reproduction guide first.

### 2. Exact Commands

Use exact commands from observation, not paraphrased versions.

### 3. Complete Context

Include all prerequisites, environment details, and dependencies.

### 4. Verifiable Steps

Every step should have verification to confirm success.

### 5. Actionable Output

Reproduction guide should be copy-pasteable and executable.
